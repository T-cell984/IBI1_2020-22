After reading the formative feedback, I realized some mistakes for my code and I have corrected them:
1. I didn't add the title for each plot in the formative portfolio so I add the titile for each plot now.
2. In Practical 5 file mysterycode.py, the task was to select a number which was less than 50, actually my code can work out but I guess I didn't use enough pseudocode to explain
that I used >=50 to be a restriction, so the marking teacher thought I got a number larger than 50 not less than 50. To avoid misunderstanding, I added pseudocode to explain my code.
3. My first practical was terrible because at that time, I was not so familiar with Git and GitHub. I didn't notice that I have not finished some requirements in Practical 1.
So I did those tasks such as adding a reflection file and editing my page after receiving the formative feedback.
In all, I am very thankful for the formative feedback, which checked my code portfolio carefully and gave practical advice. I have learned a lot through this and I hope I can perform better in the code portfolio for later practicals.
